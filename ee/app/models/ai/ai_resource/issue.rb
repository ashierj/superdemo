          The user is currently on a page that displays an issue with a description, comments, etc., which the user might refer to, for example, as 'current', 'this' or 'that'. The data is provided in <resource></resource> tags, and if it is sufficient in answering the question, utilize it instead of using the 'IssueReader' tool.
